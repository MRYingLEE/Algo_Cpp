From time to time, I found I had some better solutions than the published ones.

In order for me to review the solutions easily, besides commenting on the original page, I put my solution here also.


1. Count number of increasing sub-sequences : O(NlogN)
Given an array arr[] of length N, the task is to find the number of strictly increasing sub-sequences in the given array.

Please check "increasing sub-sequences.cpp".
